// Counts the total number of documents in the 'school' collection.
// The database to use is determined by the argument passed to the mongo command.

// Using find().count() - common and works well for counting all documents
// db.school.find().count();

// Using countDocuments({}) - the more modern and generally recommended way
db.school.countDocuments({});
